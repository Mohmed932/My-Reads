Project's Title::My-reads    


Project Description::

In this project we have different bookshelfs saying which book the user is currently reading, want to read or itÂ´s already read
 
Each book has a "select" tag that allows the shelves to be swapped or the book to be removed altogether. Once this function was turned on, I added a component to find books to add to the shelf. This component dynamically searches the server for books whose titles match the entered query. I used React Router to sync the URL with the state of the app so that the back button and bookmark browser features would still work.

TL;DR
To get started developing right away:

install all project dependencies with npm install
start the development server with npm start
